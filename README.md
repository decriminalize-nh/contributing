# About

Decriminalize NH is a non-partisan community of activists, lawyers, policymakers, academics, and ordinary Granite Staters working to create a more peaceful and prosperous New Hampshire by repealing bad criminal laws.

> A bad criminal law is any law that brands people as a criminal even if their actions are peaceful, consensual, honest, and/or unlikely to cause harm to the persons or property of others. 
> 
> A bad criminal law is also any law that targets a legitimate offense, but that imposes a disproportionate or counterproductive penalty on offenders. We believe that responses to crime should be evidence-based and aim for restorative justice, rehabilitation, and public safety rather than punishment for the sake of punishment.
