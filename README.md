# How to contribute to Decriminalize NH projects

## Step 1. Create a GitHub account
Visit https://github.com/join and create an account.

GitHub uses Markdown for text formatting. If you don't already know the basics of Markdown, you can learn [here](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/writing-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax). An easy way to see how Markdown looks in practice, outside of the examples provided in the previous documentation link, is to click the "Raw" button on any Markdown file on GitHub (denoted by the file extension `.md`). For example, the raw Markdown file for this document can be found [here](https://github.com/decriminalize-nh/contributing/raw/main/README.md). You don't _have_ to use Markdown, but it is nice to know how to in case you need to format text and a [WYSIWYG text editor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG) isn't available in the text field you are typing in.

## Step 2. Pick a project you want to contribute to
Take a look through the projects in the [Decriminalize NH organization](https://github.com/decriminalize-nh) and decide which one you want to contribute to. 

Let's say for example you are interested in helping with drug decriminalization.

Click on the name of the project (the blue link that says `decriminalize-drugs`) to enter the project repository (or "repo", for short). 

Click through the files and directories in the repo to familiarize yourself with the contents.

## Step 3. Create an issue to discuss any ideas/questions/feedback you have
Once you have familiarized yourself with the repo's contents, you can feel confident leaving good feedback. The best way to start a conversation if you have any ideas for improvement, questions, or feedback about the content is to create an issue in the project's repo.

## Step 4. Create a pull request to add a suggested change
Pull requests are used to suggest changes to a repo on GitHub. These changes can include editing an existing document, creating a new document, or uploading a file.

To edit an existing document, first click on the document you want to edit. Make sure the document is on the "Main" branch, so that you're editing the most recent "main" version of the file you're looking at. Then click the little pencil icon at the top of the document to begin editing.
