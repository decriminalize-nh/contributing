# About

Decriminalize NH is a non-partisan community of activists, lawyers, policymakers, academics, and ordinary Granite Staters working to create a more peaceful and prosperous New Hampshire by repealing bad laws that make people criminals for no good reason.

All of the legislation we work on is hosted here on GitHub and worked on in public: anyone can review, and anyone can contribute.

You can find the repositories of all of our projects [here](https://github.com/decriminalize-nh).

If you want to help contribute to any of our projects, you can find a how-to guide [here](CONTRIBUTING.md).

Any questions or feedback? Feel free to start a discussion [here](https://github.com/decriminalize-nh/contributing/discussions) and let's chat about it!
