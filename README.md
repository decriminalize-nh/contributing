# How to contribute to Decriminalize NH projects

## Step 1. Create a GitHub account
Visit https://github.com/join and create an account.

## Step 2. Pick a project you want to contribute to
Take a look through the projects in the [Decriminalize NH organization](https://github.com/decriminalize-nh) and decide which one you want to contribute to. 

Let's say for example you are interested in helping with drug decriminalization.

Click on the name of the project (the blue link that says `decriminalize-drugs`) to enter the project repository (or "repo", for short). 

Read through the materials in the repo to familiarize yourself with the contents.

## Step 3. Create an issue to discuss any ideas/questions/feedback you have
Once you have familiarized yourself with the repo's contents, you can feel confident leaving good feedback. The best way to start a conversation if you have any ideas for improvement, questions, or feedback about the content is to create an issue in the project's repo.
